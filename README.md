### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm starting new projects! Check out the organizational README at github.com/delecert. Let me know if you want access for any reason, including to keep me accountable or to contribute yourself.

If we ever meet in person, you can verify that my cat looks like my profile pic.

The file pseudonym.txt.txt.gpg.gpg contains a message that identifies me under my true name and another GitHub account that I control. Decrypt it using the GPG key associated with this account, and then decrypt it again using the GPG key associated with the other account in order to discover my true name.
