My pseudonym is Olivia LaNova, acting in the capacity of the primary founder of Delecert. This statement is located on GitHub, publically available, and signed using the system that GitHub uses to sign commits via the web browser.

I am free to make my own decisions. The date is March 8th, 2024.

Decision
===
The decision that I am making is the following:
* I give myself a preliminary Delecert reputation score of 20.
* I am the only one that can designate preliminary Delecert reputation scores.

The decision(s) that I am explicitly NOT making includes the following:
* What the maximum allowable Delecert reputation score shall be.

Explanation
===

The factors influencing my decision include the following:
* 20 is the maximum number on a D20 die, which might prove useful in potential games.
* I try very hard to be honest, and I want this current document to be as complete as possible.
* This document is one of the only things that I have completed under this pseudonym, and I am reasonably confident that this document is of high quality.
* I am aware that it is very hard to be completely honest and accurate at the same time.
* The numbers 0-20 can be easily turned into a percentage by multiplying times 5, so that people who want a percent confidence can have the number in that format with a simple transformation.
* If we need ratings in between the counting numbers, there is a straightforward and meaningful way of obtaining those ratings.
* I am trying to avoid legalese and unnecessary confusion, while still being specific enough to be useful.
  
The factors which do not influence my decision include the following:
* Any current state of impairment to my thinking that I am aware of. I am sane and sober at the moment.
* Coincidental rankings with 20 ranks.
* Coincidental groups of size 20.

The information that might change my decision include the following:
* If the name Delecert or "preliminary Delecert reputation score" is somehow disputed.
  
The information that will not change my decision include the following:
* If someone is determined to have a higher or lower preliminary Delecert reputation score than myself.

The circumstances that might change my decision include the following:
* If I am convinced that I do not deserve the maximum repuation score for my personal reputation.
* I am convinced that a different number would make sense as a maximum number for a reputation score.

The circumstances that will not change my decision include the following:
* An update to the influence that preliminary Delecert reputation score wields.

I reserve the right(s) to
* institute a new mechanism for granting Delecert reputation scores, preliminary or not.
* give myself a new preliminary Delecert reputation score.
  

As far as I know, this statement is not legally binding. However, I guarantee the honesty and completeness of this document entitled dd-olive/claim_template.md with 
* my personal honor
* the honor of my GitHub account
* the honor of the capacity in which I am acting

If I wanted to include any further guarantees of the honesty and completeness of this document and the decision it contains, I would obtain legal council as to whether and how to include them in this document.
